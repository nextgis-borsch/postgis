.SH NAME
raster2pgsql \- loads GDAL supported raster formats into a PostGIS raster table
.SH DESCRIPTION
raster2pgsql is a raster loader executable that loads GDAL supported raster formats into sql suitable for loading into a PostGIS raster table. It is capable of loading folders of raster files as well as creating overviews of rasters.
.TP
Since the raster2pgsql is compiled as part of PostGIS most often (unless you compile your own GDAL library), the raster types supported by the executable will be the same as those compiled in the GDAL dependency library. To get a list of raster types your particular raster2pgsql supports use the \-G switch. These should be the same as those provided by your PostGIS install documented here ST_GDALDrivers if you are using the same gdal library for both.
.SH "SYNOPTIS"
.HP
raster2pgsql [<options>] <raster>[ <raster>[ ...]] [[<schema>.]<table>]
.HP
Multiple rasters can also be specified using wildcards (*,?).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.HP
\fB\-s\fR <srid> Set the raster's SRID. Defaults to 0. If SRID not
.IP
provided or is 0, raster's metadata will be checked to
determine an appropriate SRID.
.HP
\fB\-b\fR <band> Index (1\-based) of band to extract from raster. For more
.IP
than one band index, separate with comma (,). Ranges can be
defined by separating with dash (\-). If unspecified, all bands
of raster will be extracted.
.HP
\fB\-t\fR <tile size> Cut raster into tiles to be inserted one per
.IP
table row. <tile size> is expressed as WIDTHxHEIGHT.
<tile size> can also be "auto" to allow the loader to compute
an appropriate tile size using the first raster and applied to
all rasters.
.HP
\fB\-P\fR Pad right\-most and bottom\-most tiles to guarantee that all tiles
.IP
have the same width and height.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
Register the raster as an out\-of\-db (filesystem) raster. Provided
raster should have absolute path to the file
.IP
(\fB\-d\fR|a|c|p) These are mutually exclusive options:
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Drops the table, then recreates it and populates
it with current raster data.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Appends raster into current table, must be
exactly the same table schema.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Creates a new table and populates it, this is the
default if you do not specify any options.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Prepare mode, only creates the table.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR <column> Specify the name of the raster column
.TP
\fB\-F\fR
Add a column with the filename of the raster.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR <column> Specify the name of the filename column. Implies \fB\-F\fR.
.HP
\fB\-l\fR <overview factor> Create overview of the raster. For more than
.IP
one factor, separate with comma(,). Overview table name follows
the pattern o_<overview factor>_<table>. Created overview is
stored in the database and is not affected by \fB\-R\fR.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Wrap PostgreSQL identifiers in quotes.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR
Create a GIST spatial index on the raster column. The ANALYZE
command will automatically be issued for the created index.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR
Run VACUUM ANALYZE on the table of the raster column. Most
useful when appending raster to existing table with \fB\-a\fR.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
Set the standard set of constraints on the raster
column after the rasters are loaded. Some constraints may fail
if one or more rasters violate the constraint.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Disable setting the max extent constraint. Only applied if
\fB\-C\fR flag is also used.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Set the constraints (spatially unique and coverage tile) for
regular blocking. Only applied if \fB\-C\fR flag is also used.
.HP
\fB\-T\fR <tablespace> Specify the tablespace for the new table.
.IP
Note that indices (including the primary key) will still use
the default tablespace unless the \fB\-X\fR flag is also used.
.HP
\fB\-X\fR <tablespace> Specify the tablespace for the table's new index.
.IP
This applies to the primary key and the spatial index if
the \fB\-I\fR flag is used.
.HP
\fB\-N\fR <nodata> NODATA value to use on bands without a NODATA value.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
Skip NODATA value checks for each raster band.
.HP
\fB\-E\fR <endian> Control endianness of generated binary output of
.IP
raster. Use 0 for XDR and 1 for NDR (default). Only NDR
is supported at this time.
.HP
\fB\-V\fR <version> Specify version of output WKB format. Default
.IP
is 0. Only 0 is supported at this time.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Execute each statement individually, do not use a transaction.
.TP
\fB\-Y\fR
Use COPY statements instead of INSERT statements.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR
Print the supported GDAL raster formats.
